# 1. Load and Prepare Data
# Read the CSV file containing sequencing read counts for each sample and OTU
# This file should be in a matrix-like format (rows = samples, columns = OTUs, values = read counts)
sample_read_seq_mat <- read_csv("sequening_reads_number.csv") %>%

# 2. Perform iNEXT Analysis

# 3. Generate and Customize the Plot
p1 <- ggiNEXT(rc_reads, type = 1, color.var = "None")

# Customize the appearance of the plot
p11 <- p1 +
  theme_test() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') +

# 4. Save the Plot
# Save the final customized plot to a file
